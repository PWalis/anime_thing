Here I will learn about docker why it's useful and how to use it

CONTAINER
    - a container is simply another process on you machine that has been isolated
      from all other processes on the host machine 
    - When unning a container, it uses an isolated filesystem
    CONTAINER IMAGE
      - Provieds the isolated filesystem
      - Must contain everything an app needs to run

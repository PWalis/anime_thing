I want to create a recommender system but I have very little knowledge on how to build one so I will
learn!

RECOMMENDER SYSTEM 
    - Collaborative method
        - NO MODEL
            - use nearest neighbors to get distance between users(reviewers) and items(anime)
              (also considered as a no model approach and doesn't work very well for new user recommendations)
            - large sparse vectors
        - MODEL 
            - use a model
    
    - CONTENT BASED SYSTEMS
        - only rely on user-item interactions
        - use additional information about a user/item
        - build a model based on the available "features", that explains the 
          observed user-item interactions
        - content based systems suffer less from the cold start problem because
          they have a profile to use for recommendations
        
MODELS, BIAS, and VARIANCE
    - MEMORY BASED COLLABORATIVE method
        - low BIAS
        - high VARIANCE
    - MODEL BASED COLLABORATIVE method
        - higher BIAS
        - lower VARIANCE
    - MODEL BASED CONTENT method
        - highest BIAS 
        - lowest VARIANCE 

MEMORY BASED COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES
- The main characteristics of user-user and item-item approaches it that they use only information
  from the user-item interaction matrix and they assume no model to produce new recommendations
    - USER-USER 
        - identifies users with the most similar "interactions profile" (nearest neighbors)
        - suggest most popular items in nearest profiles to user 
        - consider that two users are similar if they have interacted with a lot of common
          items in the same way (many and similar=neighbors)
    - ITEM-ITEM
        - find items that are similar to the items the user has "positivly" interacted with
        - two items are similar if most of the users that have interacted with both of them 
          did it in a similar way
        - compute similarities between the "best item" and all the other items 
        - recommend items in the neighborhood(knn) of "best item"

MODEL BASED COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES
- Model based collaborative approaches only rely on user-item interactions information, and
  assume a latent model to explain these interactions
    - MATRIX FACTORIZATION
        - there exists a pretty low demensional latent space of the features in which we can
          represent both users and items as such that the interactions between users and an
          item can be obtained by computing the dot product of corresponding dense vectors
          in that space 
        - do not give explicitly the features to the model 
        - let the model discover useful features by itself and make its own representation of
          both users and items 
        MATH CONCEPT
          - using gradient decent (optimization function) to reduce reconstuction error on
            dot product of user dimension and item dimension 
          - gradient decent doesn't have to be computed over the whole dot product we consider
            only a subset of these pairs 
          - user and item dimensions are optimized at alternative steps (optimize one latent space
            at a time)
